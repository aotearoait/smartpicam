## üìÅ New Files Added

### 1. `smartpicam_optimized.py`
Enhanced version of the main application with:
- Hardware acceleration support for Pi 5
- Optimized FFmpeg pipeline with reduced memory usage
- Parallel stream testing for faster startup
- TCP transport for more reliable RTSP connections
- Configurable threading and buffer sizes
- System-level optimizations

### 2. `scripts/performance_tune.sh`
System optimization script that configures:
- CPU governor for maximum performance
- GPU memory allocation for video processing
- Network buffer optimization for RTSP streams
- Memory management tuning
- Video acceleration packages
- Device permissions and systemd services

### 3. `config/smartpicam_optimized.json`
Optimized configuration for 10-camera setup:
- Reduced window sizes for better performance
- Hardware acceleration enabled
- Small buffer sizes (32KB vs default 1MB+)
- Single thread per stream
- Low latency settings

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technical Optimizations

### FFmpeg Pipeline Improvements
- **Before**: Complex filter chains with multiple decode operations
- **After**: Streamlined single-pass scaling and overlay
- **Impact**: Significant reduction in CPU and memory usage

### Threading Optimization
- **Before**: Default FFmpeg threading (8+ threads per stream)
- **After**: Limited to 1 thread per stream with optimized queue sizes
- **Impact**: Dramatic reduction in thread count and context switching

### Network Optimization
- **Before**: UDP transport with large buffers and timeouts
- **After**: TCP transport with optimized small buffers
- **Impact**: More reliable streams with lower memory usage

### Hardware Acceleration
- **Before**: Software-only video processing
- **After**: Pi 5 GPU acceleration where possible
- **Impact**: Reduced CPU load for video decoding

## üìã Installation Steps

### Quick Start
```bash
# On your Pi, navigate to smartpicam directory
cd /opt/smartpicam

# Checkout the performance optimization branch
sudo git fetch origin
sudo git checkout performance-optimizations

# Run the performance tuning script
sudo chmod +x scripts/performance_tune.sh
sudo ./scripts/performance_tune.sh

# Reboot to apply system changes
sudo reboot

# After reboot, test the optimized version
cd /opt/smartpicam
python3 smartpicam_optimized.py

# If working well, enable the optimized service
sudo systemctl enable smartpicam-optimized
sudo systemctl start smartpicam-optimized
```

### Detailed Configuration
1. **System Optimization**: Run `performance_tune.sh` for Pi 5 optimizations
2. **Configuration**: Use `config/smartpicam_optimized.json` or adapt your existing config
3. **Service**: Use the new `smartpicam-optimized.service` for better resource management

## üìä Monitoring and Verification

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor real-time performance
./monitor_performance.sh

# Verify optimizations are applied
./verify_optimizations.sh

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status smartpicam-optimized
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u smartpicam-optimized -f

# Monitor resources
htop

# Check thermal status
watch vcgencmd measure_temp
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### New Display Settings
The optimized version adds several new configuration options:

```json
{
  "display": {
    "hardware_accel": true,     // Enable Pi 5 GPU acceleration
    "low_latency": true,        // Optimize for low latency
    "buffer_size": "32k",       // Small buffers for lower memory
    "thread_count": 1,          // Threads per stream
    "preset": "ultrafast"       // FFmpeg preset for speed
  }
}
```

## üéØ Compatibility

- **Raspberry Pi 5**: Fully optimized with hardware acceleration
- **Raspberry Pi 4**: Compatible with software optimizations
- **Memory**: Recommended 4GB+ RAM for 10 cameras
- **Storage**: Class 10 SD card or better recommended

## üîÑ Migration from Original

### Backup Current Setup
```bash
sudo cp smartpicam.py smartpicam.py.backup
sudo cp config/smartpicam.json config/smartpicam.json.backup
```

### Test Before Switching
1. Test optimized version manually first
2. Verify all cameras display correctly
3. Monitor resource usage
4. Check for any errors in logs

### Switch Services
```bash
# Stop old service
sudo systemctl stop smartpicam

# Start optimized service
sudo systemctl start smartpicam-optimized
sudo systemctl enable smartpicam-optimized
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Reboot Required**: System optimizations require a reboot to take effect
2. **Temperature Monitoring**: Monitor Pi temperature after optimization
3. **Camera URLs**: Update to use sub-streams where possible for best performance
4. **Network**: Ensure stable network connection for all cameras

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **First Startup**: May take longer on first run while building filter graphs
2. **High Resolution**: Very high resolution streams may still cause issues
3. **Network Timeouts**: Poor network connections may require timeout adjustments

## üìà Performance Tuning Tips

### For Very High Camera Counts (8+)
- Use camera sub-streams instead of main streams
- Reduce individual camera resolution
- Consider camera rotation/cycling
- Monitor thermal throttling

### For Lower-End Hardware
- Disable hardware acceleration if causing issues
- Increase buffer sizes if network is unstable
- Reduce concurrent camera count
- Use lower resolution displays
